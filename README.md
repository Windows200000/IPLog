### This is the first project I ever coded from scratch, so it's not written well, but it works.
The Mailing function might not work anymore. I use the project, but not the mailing function, so I haven't bothered to keep up with the API.

## How to use
- Clone the repo
- Rename `RENAME TO(restart.ps1)` to `restart.ps1`
- Run once
- If you want to modify check frequency or get emails, you'll have to fill out `settings.json`
- some more options and debug options are at the top of `IPLog.js`
- Run again or configure to run at startup
